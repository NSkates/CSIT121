            <p>Welcome to my webpage! In this lab, you will see a little bit of what I've learned so far in CSIT 121!</p>
            <p>A website that's guided me to learn HTML is <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css">here</a>!</p>
            <hr>
            <h3 class="heads">Reflections...</h3>
            <p>For the second lab, I was able to create my first website from scratch! I was able to enforce proper HTML 
                structure and use semantic tags effectively. My biggest takeaway from this lab that I learned while working
                 on it was how to make a website print out tags. While working on this lab, when I tried to list the unique
                  image and break tags, the brackets wouldn't show up on the website when I just typed "&lt;img&gt;". 
                  I later learned that in order to make that happen, you must include an "and" symbol (&), following "lt"
                  and another "and" symbol (&) following "gt;". This was a very important lesson for me to learn 
                  because without it, the website would not display the tags properly!
                </p><p>
                  As for this latest third lab, I utilized the same website as before to help me apply what I learned about
                   CSS. Specifically, external CSS. My biggest takeaway from this lab was honestly being careful
                   on what fonts and colors I chose. I found it very easy to type what I wanted, but choosing what I wanted
                   to put on here was a different story. I had to make sure that the colors I chose for the background 
                   and text were not too bright or too dull, and that the font I chose was easy to read. 
                </p>

            <h3 class = "heads">Here are the Most Important Things to Know When Creating a Website...</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Tags Must Have Open and Closing Brackets</li>
                <li>Attribute Tags linking to other page(s) must be enclosed in double quotes</li>
                <li>HTML's structure is like a skeleton!</li>
            </ol>
