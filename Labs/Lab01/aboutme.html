            <p>
                Hello! My name is Nicole and I'm a Computer Information Systems major! I don't have a lot of programming experience yet, as I only have experience in Python and Java.
                 I'm excited to gain experience in front end programming! I'm taking this class because it's a requirement for my major.

             I'm majoring in Computer Information Systems, in the Data Analytics track! I'm currently a junior.

            <p>

                Outside of school, I'm a competitive figure skater! I've been skating for 10 years. I also like to create videos for TikTok sometimes. Additionally, I like to play video games when I get the chance. 
                My favorite game is Minecraft, but I'm really looking forward to playing Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream on my Nintendo Switch once it releases in a few months!
